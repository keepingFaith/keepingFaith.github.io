				<p class="blogtitle">Prayer Life </p>
				<p class="date">May 1st, 2016 </p>
				<p>Monday through Friday, a friend of mine sends out a group message to a couple
				dozen of his friends. Each one has been inspiring and uplifting, but this Friday's
				was such an essential topic in the Christian walk.</p>
				<blockquote><p>"Prayer is a powerful thing. It can be so easy to take for granted
				that we have direct access to the creator of the universe anytime we WANT. So
				it's unfortunate that most of our prayers come at a time that we NEED."</p>
				<p>"Now don't get me wrong, prayer is definitely designed for our needs, but it's
				also designed to strengthen our relationship with God, too, communicating our needs
				and wants is only part of it."</p>
				<p class="bibleVerse">"'The Lord is near to all who call on Him in truth." -Psalms
				 145:18</p>
				 <p>"Just as you desire a relationship with God, He also desires a relationship
				 with you. Just like an earthly relationship, you have to spend time with it, it
				 doesn't happen overnight, but the more time you spend with someone, the better
				 you get to know them."</p> 
				 <p>"So how do we do that? What so we pray for?"</p>
				 <p>"Well, we covered needs and wants, how about prayers of forgiveness? Prayers 
				 of thanks? Prayers for others? Don't just hope for wisdom, or intelligence, or self 
				 control, or joy, or a loving heart, or patience, etc, pray for it!"</p>
				 <p class="bibleVerse">"'This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask
				 anything according to His will, he hears.'-1 John 5:14"</p>
				 <p>"Let God be the first person you run to in times of need, thanks, apology, you name
				 it. You get out of it what you put into it!" </p>
				 <p>"TAKEAWAY: God desperately wants to know you and for you to know Him. Ask and you shall
				 recieve, but like any relationship, you must cultivate. Start creating a healthy and active
				 prayer life."</p>
				 <p>"PRAYER: God, instill in me a vibrant and open prayer life, help me to come to you
				 not just in times of need but through everything for I know that you are the only
				 the only true and just thing in my life, develop in me a yearning for your presence and hand 
				a desire to hand in my life!"</p></blockquote>
