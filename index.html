				<p class="first">Hey guys! The name is Faith!</p>
				<p>A little about myself: I'm twenty-two years old. I attend 29:11 Church in Arizona
				and am actively seeking Christ's presence in my life. I've heard some pretty negative things about the 
				Millennial Generation. They are said to be lazy, entitled and Godless.</p>
				<p>To be honest, some of it is true. There are a lot of lazy and Godless Millennials. But I happen to know 
				plenty of hard-working and God fearing millennials as well. And if you don't know any, then you are not hanging
				with the right people. The group of Millennial’s I'm talking about are passionate about God and eager to serve 
				their community. They pray for one another and use words of encouragement to build one another up. They seek wisdom
				and work hard. <p>
				<p> I want to show the world what a millennial’s walk with Christ looks like. This is one of the platforms I use to 
				accomplish that. I have <a href="devotionals.html">Devotionals</a> available, <a href="projects.html">volunteer projects</a> 
				and <a href="blog.html">blog posts</a>, so take a look and see if anything peeks your interest!
