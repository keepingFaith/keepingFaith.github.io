			<blockquote cite="http://biblehub.com/niv/hebrews/10.htm">"And let us consider how we may spur one another on 
			toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging 
			one anotherâ€”and all the more as you see the Day approaching."</blockquote>
			<p><cite>-Hebrews 10:24-25 NIV</cite></p>
			<p>I know a lot of Christians who don't go to church. I was one of them for certain seasons of my life. 
			Sometimes I didn't go because I was running from God.
			 Sometimes I didn't go because I felt there were no churches that moved me.
			 Sometimes I didn't go because I felt there were no churches with correct doctrine. Or at least none that I knew
			of.</p>
			<p>I was hit and miss with church. So I never experienced community. Never experienced building relationships 
			with pepole who were seeking to serve God and make connections. If there was something I could tell the younger Me,
			it would be, "Find a community within the bride of Christ. Don't give up and be consistent!" </p>
			<p>The church is so important. Having connections with people who are striving to serve and improve is crucial
			to living a Christ centered life. It provides opportunity to serve, to lead, to love on people and to lean on
			people you can trust. Learning together and struggling together. Encouraging each other and praying for one another.</p>
			<p> I devote this year to the bride of Christ. </p>
